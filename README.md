## Project Overview
A'kitchen is a web application that allows the target audience to browse & create recipes and engage in conversations with other users who are also authenticated on the website. A'Kitchen allows users to like and comment on recipes. 
This project's goal was to create a full-stack Django application using the computer languages Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It makes use of CRUD capability so that authorised users may add expedition reviews to the website and create, browse, amend, and delete them. User registration and sign-in are implemented using the allauth Django package.

### Future Improvements
I would like to implement a number of functionality upgrades in the future. I was unable to complete my project because of a personal situation. But here is what I would have added:
1. A few of the user tales are unfinished.
2. The capability of recovering a user's password in the event that it has been lost, stolen, or corrupted.
3. Providing the option for users to share their recipes so that others can try them.
4. Give the user the option to rate the recipe once they tried.
5. Allow users to save a recipe to their favourites so that they may return to it without having to hunt for it after logging in.
6. The opportunity to let users vote on the upcoming recipe.
7. Complete the read-me file.
