## Project Overview
A'kitchen is a web application that allows the target audience to browse & create recipes and engage in conversations with other users who are also authenticated on the website. A'Kitchen allows users to like and comment on recipes. 
This project's goal was to create a full-stack Django application using the computer languages Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It makes use of CRUD capability so that authorised users may add expedition reviews to the website and create, browse, amend, and delete them. User registration and sign-in are implemented using the allauth Django package.

    - Project Goals:
        - The project's objective is to provide a platform that will enable the website owner to share her recipes with the entire world. Bring together a community that enjoys baking. A forum where they can converse, exchange recipes, and express their passion for baking.
         
    - Site owner goal:
        - Provide a platform that is user-friendly and open to everyone.
        - A website that needs to look good across all screen sizes.
        - Allows the website owner to change the existing or previous recipes
        - Allows the site owner the ability to view the likes and comments to determine which content is the most popular.

    - User goals:
        - The platform should be simple to use and straightforward for users.
        - User who love to Bake
        - Users who enjoy talking to others about recipes they've tried out from posts.
        - User looking for a kind and supportive community that recently took up baking.

### Future Improvements
I would like to implement a number of functionality upgrades in the future. I was unable to complete my project because of a personal situation. But here is what I would have added:
1. A few of the user tales are unfinished.
2. The capability of recovering a user's password in the event that it has been lost, stolen, or corrupted.
3. Providing the option for users to share their recipes so that others can try them.
4. Give the user the option to rate the recipe once they tried.
5. Allow users to save a recipe to their favourites so that they may return to it without having to hunt for it after logging in.
6. The opportunity to let users vote on the upcoming recipe.
7. Complete the read-me file.
